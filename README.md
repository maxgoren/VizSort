Popular sorting algorithms brought to life through data movement visualization

## Algorithm is selected by key press:

     'M'  - Top down mergesort w/ small array insertion sort
     'B'  - Bottom up mergesort
     'T'  - Tiled mergesort (bottom up)
     'F'  - Floyd's Heapsort
     'H'  - Heapsort
     'Q'  - Iterative Quicksort w/ small array insertion sort
     'I'  - Introspective Sort
     'S'  - Shellsort with Sedgewicks 3h+1 sequence
     'N'  - Insertion sort
     'K'  - Bubble sort
     'L'  - Selection sort
     'R'  - re-shuffle array using Knuth shuffle
